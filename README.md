Q'onoS Chrono (in Klingon)

Q'onoS (Kronos) is the Klingon home world.  This is the Pebble watchface people there would use. This watchface is 24 hour format because there would be no honor in using 12 hour format.

I tried to contact kaiserzharkhan about using the Klingon font.  The website http://truefonts.blogspot.com still exists, but I couldn't find a contact or email.

This watchface was developed with PebbleSDK-2.0.2 and locally built arm toolchain on Fedora 19 as described here http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/12916/here-are-my-notes-to-get-a-working-pebblesdk-and-simulator-on-a-fresh-install-of-fedora-19.
